# copper-parse-sql-flow

`copper-parse-sql-flow` packages a practical parsers exercise in Ruby. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Copper Parse SQL Flow

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Internal Model

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Ruby code keeps the module small and leans on Minitest for direct fixture checks.

## Problem Shape

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Main Behaviors

- Uses fixture data to keep error labels changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for grammar boundaries, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents golden examples tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Scenario Walkthrough

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Repository Map

- `lib`: library code
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Run It Locally

Install Ruby and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Known Edges

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more parsers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
